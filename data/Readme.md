## 训练数据

这里我们用于微调的是[smile](https://github.com/qiuhuachuan/smile)的数据集。

```bash
git clone https://github.com/qiuhuachuan/smile
```
修改`convert2xtuner_training_set.py`文件中`source_dir`的路径为smile数据集的路径

## Xtuner介绍

XTuner 训练多轮对话模型时，采取了一种更加充分高效的方法，如下图所示。

<div align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/LZHgrla/xtuner/assets/36994684/ec67b610-a3b2-4fa7-91ad-a9a235fdb820" alt="Image" width=1100" />
</div>

我们将多轮对话进行拼接，之后输入模型，并行计算每个位置的 loss，而只有 Output 部分的 loss 参与回传。

XTuner 中多轮对话数据集格式如下所示：

```json
[{
    "conversation":[
        {
            "system": "You are an AI asssistant."
            "input": "Hello?",
            "output": "Hello! How can I help you?"
        },
        {
            "input": "What's the date today?",
            "output": "Today is Monday, August 14, 2023."
        },
        {
            "input": "Thank you!",
            "output": "You are welcome."
        }
    ]
},
{
    "conversation":[
        {
            "system": "You are an AI asssistant."
            "input": "Hello?",
            "output": "Hello! How can I help you?"
        },
        {
            "input": "How's the weather today in Rosso?",
            "output": "The weather in Rosso on Wednesday, August 16th, is going to be cloudy for most of the day, together with moderate rain around noon."
        },
        {
            "input": "Thank you!",
            "output": "You are welcome."
        }
    ]
}]
```

数据集中的 "conversation" 键对应的值是一个列表，用于保存每一轮对话的指令和实际回答（GroundTruth）。为了保持格式统一，增量预训练数据集和单轮对话数据集中的 "conversation" 键也对应一个列表，只不过该列表的长度为 1。而在多轮对话数据集中，"conversation" 列表的长度为 n，以容纳 n 轮的对话内容。

`convert2xtuner_training_set.py`就是把smile数据集中data中json数据的格式转换成xtuner能用的数据形态。
